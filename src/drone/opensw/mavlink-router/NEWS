mavlink-router 1
================

    - Route mavlink messages between endpoints
    - Support UART and UDP endpoints for flight stack (both ArduPilot and PX4)
      and UART, UDP and TCP endpoints for other components
    - TCP endpoints are automatically added/removed upon connection
    - Save flight stack logs for ArduPilot (binlog) and PX4 (ulog)
    - Minimal/opportunistic parsing on MAVLink messages to avoid overhead
